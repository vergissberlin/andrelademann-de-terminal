Hi dude!
--------

I am a it specialist like you located in Leipzig, Germany, Europe, earth, milky way.
I love programming. I love to automate. I love the internet of things.
However, I do not like regex, facebook and unempatic people.

And if you ask me:
- tabs over spaces
- vim over emacs
- Atom over Sublime
- MacOS for ever!
